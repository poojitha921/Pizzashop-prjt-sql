## 🧪 SQL Analysis Performed

The following SQL queries were written to extract key business insights from the restaurant’s order data:

- *Total Revenue*: Calculates the sum of all sales from pizzas, beverages, desserts, and sides.
- *Most Popular Item*: Identifies the item (of any type) with the highest quantity sold.
- *Customer Summary*: Shows each customer’s total number of orders and total spending.
- *Daily Sales Report*: Displays daily revenue and total orders over time.
- *Top 3 Best-Selling Pizzas*: Lists the top 3 pizzas based on quantity sold.

These queries provide valuable insights for restaurant performance monitoring.

## 📊 Excel Dashboard

After executing the SQL queries, the results were exported to *Excel* to create a clean and easy-to-read dashboard with the following sheets:

| Sheet Name         | Contents                                   |

| Total Revenue    | Total revenue value with styled card       |
| Most Popular Item| Item type and ID with quantity sold chart  |
| Customer Orders  | Total orders and spend per customer        |
| Daily Sales      | Line chart showing revenue by date         |
| Top 3 Pizzas     | Bar chart for best-selling pizzas
